Manifesto for Agile Software Development
We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:
Individuals and interactions over processes and tools Working software over comprehensive documentation Customer collaboration over contract negotiation Responding to change over following a plan
That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

How long would it take your organisation<br>
to deploy a change that involves<br>
just one single line of code.

Do you do this on a repeatable, reliable basis?

# Continuous Delivery

* Software always production ready
* Releases tied to business needs, not operational constraints

!SLIDE incremental

# What Continuous Delivery is not

* Continuous Integration
* Continuous Deployment
* Deployment Tools


!SLIDE incremental

# Benefits for the Business

* Validate business plan, faster earlier
* Costs are more predictable
* Can respond to market demands


!SLIDE incremental

# Benefits for IT

* Less risk per release
* Feedback on development process
