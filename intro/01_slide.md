1) This workshop usually takes one day. I condensed it to fit in one hour.

When talking about CD you might get the feeling "this will NEVER work for me / in my organization."

THESE are exactly the pain points you should tackle.

2) The story:

When giving a presentation it's often told it's best to tell a story to the audience.

Well, I can tell stories, because each deployment of a new software version used to be a horror story.

Back in the days.

This talk is about the journey I had giving a customer the freedom to deploy whenever they felt it's the right time.

And it's also about YOUR story. I'm happy to hear your story on how you deploy software and release new features.

It's OK to ask.
